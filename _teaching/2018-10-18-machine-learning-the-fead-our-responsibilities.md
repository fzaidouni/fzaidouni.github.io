I got the opportunity to discuss the fad surrounding machine learning with budding ML scientists at [WiML](https://www.facebook.com/delhiwimlds) (Women in Machine Learning).

![The presentation](/images/wimlds.JPG)


Much of this presentation was inspired by my discussions with Dr. Shlyakhtenko at Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics, UCLA. The presentation emphasized on the following:

1. Machine learning is statistics
2. Learn concepts, tools will follow
3. Learn to code, not frameworks (aka Numpy for life)
4. It is not a FAD!
5. Neuroscience and Machine Learning
6. Our responsibilities in the ML community
