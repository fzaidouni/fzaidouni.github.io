Out team, [me](https://github.com/himahuja), [Shubhi Sareen](https://github.com/shubhi-sareen), and [Anurag Malyala](https://github.com/IsCoelacanth) under the guidance of [Dr. Rajni Jindal](http://www.dtu.ac.in/Web/Departments/CSE/faculty/rajnijindal.php), curated and tested multiple targeted adversarial attacks on state-of-the-art robust defence models.  Our model ranked in the [top-10 submissions at the NIPS Adversarial Competition Track](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/nips-2018-adversarial-vision-challenge-targeted-attack-track/leaderboards).

The project code can be found [here](https://github.com/himahuja/NIPS-Adversarial-Competition-2018), and the Competition page can be found [here](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/nips-2018-adversarial-vision-challenge-targeted-attack-track)!
