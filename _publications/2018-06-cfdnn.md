Considering the eminence of breast cancer detection, a variety of models have been proposed for its diagnosis. Although many of these models provide high-performance accuracy, they are computationally expensive. We propose a novel ensembling method, CFDNN which aims at reducing the computational expense, whilst maintaining the high-performance accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art models in the breast cancer detection problem. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed CFDNN model is the computationally fastest model in breast cancer detection with an accuracy of 99.01%, making CFDNN an optimal choice for providing a second opinion in medical diagnosis.
