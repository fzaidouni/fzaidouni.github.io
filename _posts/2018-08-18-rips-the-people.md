The RIPS Program is a holistic experience. Not only did I see the impact of the [research we performed](/posts/2018/08/rips-the-internship) for Praedicat Inc and IPAM, but I had the honour to meet and know people from all over the world. This is one of the goals of IPAM regarding the RIPS program every year, and they were highly successful in making it happen. The 2 month internship was more than work, it was glimpse of life. This post is a thank-you note for the wonderful people I met at IPAM and how they taught me to live better and work harder.

My teammate Alex taught me organisation and scheduling. He made sure that our team was inline with all that was happening around. Although, I was always inclined towards my own slumber of code and papers, he made sure that I send out e-mails, update the reports and presentations and keep up with the conference schedules. I didn't know I could make such great friends with someone, so quickly before I met him.

My other teammate Melody taught me the value of time. While was still catching up with everything, Melody made sure that I learn to keep my meetings and my time allocations perfect. But I learnt more just by looking the way she used to do it flawlessly than from her daily scoldings.

Adam was the other fun-guy except me in the internship. I had so much fun just talking to him, he instantly became like a brother to me. I loved our wisdom "sessions" and our sporadic evening runs. He taught me that it is okay to have fun with work.

My roommate Theodore taught me how to respect. He was so patient and understanding towards me when I entered the room late at night and sometimes messed up his sleep schedule. We had only a few conversations as I spent most of my time at the office. He helped me so much when I lost my bag in the initial days of the internship. Theo was a kid inside, but I was even more of a kid. We are both a little weird for everyone, I guess that's why we became friends so naturally.  

Dr. Susana Serna, the program director for the RIPS Program. She had been so friendly and welcoming to me at all times. It was her 8th RIPS Program as program director this year, and one can see that experience in her workflow efficiency. She knew how to understand all of us. All of us from so many different cultures, attitudes and personalities. She knew how to make people do work and make sure they have fun while doing it. She made it seem so easy. She was so welcoming towards me and gave me so much knowledge on how to approach and interact with different people. All of my interaction with her taught me acceptance towards everyone and showed me that how one can have authority and still be so humble, helpful and friendly towards everyone. She doesn't like any photos of her to be posted online, and I would like to keep it that way.

Dr. Shantanu Joshi was the most calm person I have met in my entire life. He was always readily available for helping. His calm made it so comfortable and warm to talk to him. Yet, his composure spoke out so loud about his wonderful personality. He taught me to be calm and composed, and put myself out to help others.

I was honoured to have a 30-minute discussion with Dima Shlyakhtenko, the Director of IPAM. His aura was filled with wisdom and his few words made a life-long impact on my ideology towards academia. His words gave me direction and motivation towards building something bigger and foundational.

Lastly, Fatima Zaidouni taught me to question and to trust myself. She pushed me to work harder; it was like having a family away from home. Having her around was so motivational. We used to help each other grow and learn. Our conversations about philosophy, reason and religion compelled me to think. My weekend tours, lunches and so many happy memories with her will always remain unforgettable. She will always stay!    

P.S. George from the cleaning staff, I love you so much! Our midnight conversation at work made me and the office filled with life! I hope I meet you on one of your travel adventures after your retirement.
