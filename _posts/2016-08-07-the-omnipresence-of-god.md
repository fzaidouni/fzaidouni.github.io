When I was young, I often listened to a story from teachers at school and my parents of a king who was unable to decide the heir of his kingdom from his two sons. As a test he gives each one of them a banana and asks them to eat it where nobody could see them; the one who would be back soon shall be the the next king to the kingdom. The first prince hid behind a thick bush and ate the banana.

The other prince went from place to place, finding a place where nobody could watch him eat the banana, but was unable to find any such place. Both the sons came back to the king, one victorious and the other unable to complete the test. The king asked the second prince why was he unable to find such a place to which the prince replied, “Father, wherever I went, god was always watching over him and hence I failed your test.” The king made the second prince, the heir to the crown.

The story left me in awe in my childhood. The story resurfaced today when I was reading another text from Ram Dass’s book ‘Be Here Now’ which had a slightly different version.

There’s a Sikh story about a holy man who gave two men each a chicken and said, “Go Kill where no one can see.” One guy went behind the fence and killed the chicken. The other guy walked around for two days and came with the chicken.
The holy man asked,”You didn’t kill the chicken?” to which the guy replied, “Well, everywhere I go, the chicken sees.”

Even though the first story is the crux of the latter… for years it kept me in an oblivion of a mighty figure which sees all – the omnipresence of god. In the process of making it simple, the story transferred a message which the great thinkers never wished to spread.

It is simple as I think of it now. You see, you are your own god. I am my own grandpa. I am the chicken, the chicken is me. The god is the perfect mirror of what you are and he is where you are. Hence he is everywhere for you and for everybody else. **The omnipresence of god.**
