excerpt: "Let’s make a wish, or let’s not… Let’s open those eyes wide open, or shut them close… Let’s think for a minute, or just relax… I don’t know or do I?"

Let’s make a wish, or let’s not… Let’s open those eyes wide open, or shut them close… Let’s think for a minute, or just relax… I don’t know or do I?

Focus. We’ve to fix a perspective, don’t we? We, or is it just me?

I WISH TO WRITE THIS STORY! I Wish that you clear your mind before you read this. I Wish that you give this a chance. Let’s do it. We will consider that there exists no right/ no wrong, no definite yes/ no definite no, no positives/ no negatives. We’ll consider that polarity has ceased to exist.

**Story 1: Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi**

Gandhi was a man of experiments than of principles. His stubbornness, his Will to stick to the practices of non-violence, make India a free nation and his Wish to devote himself to his experiments drove a nation of 300 million people out of their agony into a magnificent chaos. The same commitment that served as a source of Will for millions of Indians to stand against the brutality of the English Imperialism turned into an act of stubbornness that drove thousands of Indians into the chaos of Independent India. A Will so remarkable that gathered 550 individual kingdoms and spun together the threads of hundreds of disparate communities into an indestructible piece of Khadi.

**Story 2: Adolf Hitler**

The man is considered the most barbaric personality of the 20th Century in the point of view of the general society. Killing thousands of Jews in the most ferocious way imaginable by the human mind. He Wished to exterminate an entire race and make Germany a world superpower and for this, stood alone against the Wishes of the whole world. A single might’s Will overpowering the Will of the whole entire world. A Will so inhuman yet so strong and audacious as to create a catastrophe on Earth.

**Story 3: Albert Einstein**

Einstein’s Will was to Think. His Will was to think about the physical sciences, the phenomenon of particle behavior and the characteristics of the physical world; And how beautifully his Will unraveled the most spectacular phenomenon to the eyes of those who wished to bind him into the mainstream societal structure and production economy. His Wish to know Light and travel with it took him territories that no invader, no explorer or no dictator could even mistakingly ever sight.

These remarkable men had ideologies that governments, churches or scientists disregarded and defied and these authoritarians are no wrong too, for they had their own Will. A Will to discard new ideologies, new principles or new religions to prevent entropy. As a matter of fact, History has witnessed countless rebellions, innumerable thought provoking ideologies and revelations that shuddered whole nations. Sometimes, they united the humans around the globe, sometimes they rekindled compassion and sometimes they baffled the whole world but other times they were suppressed, discredited or simply overlooked.

It’s only a matter of Will between you making a Wish and fulfilling It. You create your own Wishes, to carry on your Will. You decide your own rights and wrongs in coherence with your cognitive dissonance. You preach your Will, you practice it. You are influenced by the Will of someone else, you influence the Will of someone else.

If I Wish and carry the Will to achieve something and you Wish and carry the Will to never ever let me achieve my something… It’s only a matter of who’s Will overpowers the other. Creating new settlements for the homeless is destroying the habitats of thousands of millions of animal and plant species. The Large Hadron Collider has revealed new facts in science but perished the resources of Earth. A new of piece of IT software that accelerated the computation processes, took away the jobs of thousands. The Story of Will is not restricted to great men or women but exists in every act we do, and every act others do. The religions, the ISIS, the education system are nothing more and nothing less than their Will to be. The policemen, the terrorists, the animals, the humans, the governments, the Illuminati, the theories, the beliefs are all intertwined into this story, the story of the Will.
