excerpt: "That materialistic goal is dead, it's fixed. It's the greatest illusion of all time -- of a fixed goal. We'll call this motivation, passive."

We all aim to achieve in life, search what life is and live it to the fullest. We choose an object, a material or a position as our goal, to motivate us reach that life. That materialistic goal is dead, it's fixed. It's the greatest illusion of all time -- of a fixed goal. We'll call this motivation, passive.

An active motivation is dynamic, it has the liberty to adapt, to be better, more furnished as time goes.

The experiment consists of choosing an active motivation, something that challenges you further every-time. An example can describe the subtle difference between the two. The motivation to publish in CVPR, 2019 is a passive motivation, whereas the motivation to publish the most influential work in vision architectures to tackle perturbations is an active motivation, since many people are working towards the same field of study, which creates a constant challenge for you.  

A subtle shift of motivation from passive to active is the aim of this experiment.
