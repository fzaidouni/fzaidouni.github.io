You kept yourself from being vulnerable. You abstained pouring yourself out in the open where the naked harsh wind blows. Keeping your deepest thoughts, your most cherished moments close to your heart and protecting them from the fearsome torrents.

Over time you started nurturing them more and more. Eventually, they became you instead of being a part of you. Now, instead of protecting your deepest thoughts, you have to protect yourself from the harsh winds and the fearsome torrents.

But, sometimes in our lives, a stranger arrives. You feel home again and your deepest thoughts are poured all out in the open before you know. You are vulnerable again! You are scared.

But now you are more than your deepest thoughts because you don’t have to be your deepest thoughts. You may be deceived, cheated and lied but it’s okay for you have become more than yourself. You gave a chance to the universe you are, to go through the cosmic holocaust within your deepest self; your galactic soul danced with your most scared self and shared itself with a whole new universe of thoughts.

Now, you are thrilled, you can feel the rush of cosmic collisions. The fear of seclusion and the joy acceptance, the monotony of sadness and the zest of life, the greed for more and the calmness of ether all at once, through you.

**You are alive now.  
Be vulnerable, my friend.**
