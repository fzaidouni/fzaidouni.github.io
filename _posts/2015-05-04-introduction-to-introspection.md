We all go through a plethora of texts, meet a number of people and share a multitude of thoughts everyday. Through generations, ideas have passed by means of teachers, books, word of mouth and most importantly – power. Power holds the capacity that texts get adulterated, people, corrupted and thoughts, misinterpreted. So is this blog, the brain of an adulterated, corrupted and misinterpreted mind, but, in the pursuit of purity. Presented in the form of a course, this blog acts as a platform to preserve and share my thoughts. My journey to connect the dots from the most sacred, controversial texts. Let’s start.

> This trip is helping me get free of my  ego.  
> Because: if I get free of my ego, we all get free of our ego.  
> Because: That’s the way the trip works!  
    Because: We’re all the same being and that’s the problem – we can only move as fast as we all can move!  
    You can hear this message only as purely as I am pure.   
    That’s the way it boils down ~  
    I can resonate with you in the highest place I am.  
    So: I can do nothing for you but work on myself…  
    You can do nothing for me but work on yourself!    
    **Be Here Now, Ram Dass**
