[*Dr. Tapan K. Gandhi*](http://www.tapangandhi.com/) has been associated with the project [*Prakash*](http://web.mit.edu/sinhalab/prakash.html) at MIT since the past 7 years wherein he studied the vision development in onset vision patients. The aim of Project *Prakash* - 'to bring light into the lives of
curably blind children and, in so doing, illuminate some of
the most fundamental scientific questions about how
the brain develops and learns to see' was deeply inspiring and lead me to work under his guidance to learn about experimentations in vision and computational neuroscience.


 His research [Development of pattern vision following early and extended blindness](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/5/2035) was the basis of my work in his lab. Our aim was to track eye-twitches (somewhat similar to Nystagamus) in surgically treated congenitally blind patients. We also wanted the device capable of achieving this be readily available everywhere, hence I designed the instrument in the form of a mobile-app. The mobile app - V100, uses the state-of-the-art CSRT algorithm and [UGF Tracker](/publication/2018-07-ugf) to collect results of amplitude and frequency of the twitches. The mobile-app is publicly available at  [here](https://github.com/himahuja/Iris-Segmentation-and-Tracking). We have hypothesised that the amplitude and frequency of these eye twitches have a direct correlation with accumulation of hierarchical data from fine to coarse levels of hierarchy, by the general observance that the amplitude of these twitches reduces with the number of days of treatment. As we are done with the development of the mobile-app, we are still collecting more results to check our hypothesis.
