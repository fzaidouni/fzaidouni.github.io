excerpt: "Such a logic system is much more powerful than our own as it portrays co-existence and ceases paradoxes to exist (which is the very boundary of implicative reasoning)."

Our school of thought for reasoning is directional and implicative. Even the previous sentence is an implicative, just like this one. Our science is of the type: *Cause & Effect* as graciously and scientifically put by Dr. Judea Pearl in his best selling book - *"The book of why?"* which discusses this implication in great detail.

The movie Arrival is based on the idea that - "The syntactical nature of reality, the real secret of magic, is that the world is made of words. And if you know the words that the world is made of, you can make of it whatever you wish." which is a quote by the philosopher, Terence McKenna. The core idea of which states that a language can rewire the brain. The movie extends this idea to a language wherein reason is circular because the language is circular (Again an implication). The timelines run parallel to each other once the humans understand the language.

This might seem fictional at first, and defies all logic systems that appear to be sane in existence but a closer thought reveals that such a logic system is much more powerful than our own as it portrays co-existence and ceases paradoxes to exist (which is the very boundary of implicative reasoning).
