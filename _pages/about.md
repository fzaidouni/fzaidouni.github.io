I am a senior year Computer Science undergrad at Delhi Technological University, New Delhi. My key research interests lie in the field of intelligence. I have learnt and worked towards various intersections of this field, namely, computational neuroscience, optimisation algorithms, visual perception and natural Language Processing.  

I have worked closely on these problems with my supervisors. (Some details about my research experience)

Some of my research has been published in Elsevier and IEEE transactions. Know more about my projects on my Github. (A little more words about my pubs and projects)

While researching on these problems, I felt a void on the available of quality content on some of the most foundational topics, which motivated me to curate youtube lectures. Eventually we founded a core college Society — Optima for openSource curation of mathematical foundations required in Machine Learning.

Some open questions I am facing right now!
1. Transition representation or sequence representation.
2.
